# apptheme
i have to say was a lot of fun while i was doing this project 
it teaches you how to apply different rules in the same time.
i have notecd that how the font gives very a high on the page result, and also was the first time for me to do the pages into other pages so i have learned how to links many pages into another within while we code write one css rules to apply it for each one faster and better.
in addation to the media query it means alot to the browser reder during the opperting of the code to apply for ddifferent devices
